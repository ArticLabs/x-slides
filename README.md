# x-slides

HTML slide-deck / presentation elements in Polymer

## Why?

  - [x] I like HTML slides
  - [x] Scale slides properly using CSS transforms
  - [x] Uses template inheritance for master slides and themes
  - [x] Uses dependency injection to find tree-scoped resources, like themes
  - [ ] Declarative transitions and animations
  - [ ] Uses routing for linkable slides
  - [ ] Presenter notes, multi-screen, and remote support
  - [ ] Use custom elements to extend slides - embed interactive content
